Variable name,Variable description (missing data coded as NA)
SurveyID,Unique ID for each survey
Date,Date: DD/MM/YYYY
Season,Season
Property,The site that the surveys are associated with (identified by land owner's surname)
Quadrat no,At each property/site in each sampling season the quadrats are numbered 1-n where n is the total number of quadrats/transects/sampling units undertaken at a site. N is dictated by the amount of relevant vegetation at each property.
